Project for **Code Academy Berlin**.

This project is part of my first Module with Code Academy Berlin. The goal is to become comfortable using Vanilla JavaScript. The project specs were to create a simple page and dynamically fill it with API content. I've used a datalist to 'suggest' search results from my initial fetch if the user doesn't know a specific pokemon name. Clicking "more" will provide access to a shuffle function, and a "type" selector which will limit results from both the search and shuffle to the selected type/s.

Clicking the resulting pokemon card will open a model with more information. Filter options are available for the Moves table and Sprites display.
